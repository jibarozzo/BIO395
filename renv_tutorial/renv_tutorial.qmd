Managing R packages can sometimes feel like a juggling act. In small project or a large analyses, keeping track of the packages you use and ensuring your work is reproducible can be challenging. This is where `renv` shines![^1]

[^1]: This tutorial was created with the support of ChatGPT o1-mini to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness in presenting the materials.

`renv` is an R package that helps you manage dependencies for your R projects, making your work more organized and reproducible. This guide will walk you through the basics of using `renv` with easy-to-follow instructions and simple examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is `renv`?

`renv` is an R package designed to help you manage the libraries (packages) your R projects depend on. It captures the state of your project's library, allowing you to recreate it exactly on another machine or at a later time. This ensures that your projects remain reproducible, meaning others (or you in the future) can run your code without issues related to missing or different package versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Use `renv`?

-   **Reproducibility**: Ensure that your projects can be replicated with the exact same package versions.
-   **Isolation**: Keep project-specific packages separate from your global R library to avoid conflicts.
-   **Collaboration**: Easily share your project with others, knowing they can recreate the same environment.
-   **Convenience**: Simplify package management with automated tracking and restoration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing `renv`

Before you can use `renv`, you need to install it. Here's how:

1.  **Open R or RStudio**.

2.  **Install `renv` from CRAN**:

    ``` r
    install.packages("renv")
    ```

3.  **Load the `renv` package**:

    ``` r
    library(renv)
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Initializing `renv` in Your Project

To start using `renv`, you need to initialize it in your project. This sets up a dedicated library for your project and begins tracking your package dependencies.

1.  **Create or open your R project** in RStudio.

2.  **Initialize `renv`**:

    ``` r
    renv::init()
    ```

    -   **What happens**:
        -   `renv` creates a project-specific library.
        -   A `renv.lock` file is generated, capturing the current state of your project's packages.

3.  **Example**:

    Suppose you have a project folder named `MyFirstProject`. Open it in RStudio and run:

    ``` r
    library(renv)
    renv::init()
    ```

    You'll see messages indicating that `renv` is setting up the environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding and Installing Packages

With `renv` initialized, you can now add packages to your project. `renv` will automatically track these packages and their versions.

1.  **Install a new package** using `install.packages()` as usual. For example:

    ``` r
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    ```

2.  **`renv` tracks the package**:

    After installation, `renv` updates the `renv.lock` file to include `ggplot2` and its version.

3.  **Example**:

    ``` r
    install.packages("dplyr")
    ```

    Running this will install `dplyr` and `renv` will note this addition in the lockfile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saving and Restoring Your Environment

### Saving Your Environment

Whenever you make changes to your packages (installing, updating, or removing), you should save the state of your environment.

-   **Automatically Save**: `renv` automatically updates the `renv.lock` file when you install or remove packages.

-   **Manual Save**: If you make changes outside of `renv`, you can manually snapshot the environment.

    ``` r
    renv::snapshot()
    ```

### Restoring Your Environment

If you or someone else clones your project repository, you can restore the exact package environment using the `renv.lock` file.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyFirstProject.git
    ```

2.  **Open the Project in RStudio**.

3.  **Restore the Environment**:

    ``` r
    renv::restore()
    ```

    -   **What happens**:
        -   `renv` reads the `renv.lock` file.
        -   Installs the specific versions of packages listed, recreating the environment.

4.  **Example**:

    After cloning, run:

    ``` r
    library(renv)
    renv::restore()
    ```

    Your project will now have the same packages and versions as when the `renv.lock` was created.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sharing Your Project

When sharing your project (e.g., via GitHub), include the following:

1.  **Project Files**:

    -   Your R scripts, data files, and any other necessary resources.

2.  **`renv.lock` File**:

    -   This file contains the exact package versions needed to run your project.

3.  **`.Rprofile`**:

    -   Automatically loads `renv` when the project is opened by executing `source("renv/activate.R")` in called from the profile.

4.  **Example GitHub Repository Structure**:

    ```         
    MyFirstProject/
    â”œâ”€â”€ R/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ analysis.R
    â”œâ”€â”€ data/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dataset.csv
    â”œâ”€â”€ renv.lock
    â”œâ”€â”€ .Rprofile
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tips and Best Practices

-   **Commit `renv.lock` to Version Control**: Always include the `renv.lock` file in your version control system (e.g., Git) to ensure others can recreate your environment.

-   **Avoid Committing the `renv` Library**: The project-specific library can be large. Instead, rely on the `renv.lock` file for reproducibility.

-   **Regular Snapshots**: After adding or updating packages, run `renv::snapshot()` to keep the lockfile up to date.

-   **Use `renv::status()`**: Check for any discrepancies between your current library and the lockfile.

    ``` r
    renv::status()
    ```

-   **Keep R Updated**: While `renv` handles package versions, keeping your R installation up to date ensures compatibility and access to the latest features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Packages Not Installing Correctly

-   **Solution**:
    -   Ensure you have internet connectivity.
    -   Check if the package name is correct.
    -   Try restarting R and running `renv::restore()` again.

### Problem: Conflicts with Existing Libraries

-   **Solution**:
    -   Make sure `renv` is properly initialized in your project.
    -   Avoid installing packages outside of the `renv` environment to prevent conflicts.

### Problem: `renv.lock` Not Updating

-   **Solution**:
    -   Run `renv::snapshot()` manually to update the lockfile.
    -   Ensure you have write permissions to the project directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

`renv` is a powerful tool that simplifies package management in R, ensuring your projects are reproducible and your dependencies are well-organized. Using `renv`, in combination with Git and Github, enables you to confidently manage your R packages, collaborate with others, and maintain consistent environments across different systems. It is not perfect, checkout some of the [caveats](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#caveats), but it is great tool to have and use as a scientist and programmer.
